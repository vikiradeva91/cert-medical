		  Have you finished designing, developing, and manufacturing, and is
		  your product ready to enter the market? When trading medical devices
		  on the European market, obtaining the CE-mark is mandatory for every
		  company or entity. With the CE-mark you declare that the medical
		  device is in compliance with all legal requirements of the European
		  market. The Medical Device Regulation (EU) 2017/745 is a set of
		  requirements and processes for you as responsible party. When your
		  medical device is in accordance with this set of requirements, the
		  CE-mark can be affixed and the medical device can be legally
		  introduced to the European market.
		</p>
		<h3 style="font-weight: bold">
		  MEETING THE EU MEDICAL DEVICE REGULATIONS
		</h3>
		<p>
		  As responsible entity you have to ensure that your medical device
		  and its documentation meet the EU medical device directive. Where do
		  you start? Every case is different and has its own unique
		  characteristics. We have years of experience in medical product
		  certification in the EU and internationally, and offer swift and
		  tailored certification of your medical device. Our consultants have
		  complete knowledge of the EUâ€™s medical device classification
		  standards, so if you are unsure whether your product is classified
		  as a medical device in Europe, we can confirm for you. With our
		  certification process, we guarantee your medical device and
		  documentation will meet all mandatory provisions. All we need is
		  specific information of the medical device and we will arrange the
		  rest.
